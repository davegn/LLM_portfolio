       "3. **Lao Gan Ma Selection:** Use the \"big three\" products (chili oil with black bean, fried chili in oil, spicy chili crisp) based on desired flavor profile.  \n",
       "4. **Cabbage Substitution:** If Napa cabbage is unavailable, regular cabbage can be used as a substitute.  \n",
       "5. **Serving Suggestion:** Pair with a soothing soup (e.g., milky century egg soup) for balance, as mentioned in the transcript.  \n",
